    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Start the salad: Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in tortellini and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the tortellini float to the top and the filling is hot, about 3 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>While the tortellini is cooking, make the dressing: Whisk oil, both vinegars, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Finish the salad: Drain tortellini, then rinse with cold water and drain again. Transfer to a large bowl and add artichoke hearts, mozzarella, pepperoni, olives, and green onions. Pour dressing over top and toss until well combined. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.</p>
