    <h1>Tortellini Salad</h1>
    <img src="tortellini.jpg" alt="tortellini picture">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tortellini is a ring-shaped Italian pasta stuffed with cheese or meat that is most traditionally served in broth (en brodo), though other sauces—including those made from tomato, mushroom, or meat—are also popular.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tortellini</li>
        <li>Onion, garlic, carrots, and fennel</li>
        <li>Fresh thyme</li>
        <li>Diced tomatoes and their juices</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Start the salad: Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in tortellini
                and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the tortellini float to the top and the
                filling is hot, about 3 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>While the tortellini is cooking, make the dressing: Whisk oil, both vinegars, Italian seasoning, salt, and
                pepper together in a bowl.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Finish the salad: Drain tortellini, then rinse with cold water and drain again. Transfer to a large bowl and
                add artichoke hearts, mozzarella, pepperoni, olives, and green onions. Pour dressing over top and toss until
                well combined. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.</p>
