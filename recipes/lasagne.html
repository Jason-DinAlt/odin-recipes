        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>First, make the b√©chamel sauce. Put the milk, onion, bay leaves and cloves into a large saucepan and bring
            very gently just up to the boil. Turn off the heat and set aside for 1 hr to infuse.</p>
    </li>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>For the meat sauce, put the oil, celery, onion, carrot, garlic and pancetta in another large saucepan. Gently
            cook together until the veg is soft but not coloured.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Tip in the beef and pork mince, the milk and chopped tomatoes. Using a wooden spoon, stir together and break
            up and mash the lumps of mince against the sides of the pan. When the mince is mostly broken down, stir in
            all the herbs, the stock cubes and the red wine, and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook for 1 hr, stirring
            occasionally to stop the bottom catching.</p>
